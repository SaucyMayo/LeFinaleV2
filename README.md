## 💡 Exam Day Tips

### Before the Exam
- ✅ Bring non-programmable calculator
- ✅ Write in ink (pencil = no mark queries allowed!)
- ✅ Bring student card
- ✅ Arrive 15 minutes early
- ✅ Review quick reference sheet one last time

### During the Exam
- ✅ Read instructions carefully
- ✅ Budget your time (80 marks in 3 hours = ~2.25 min per mark)
- ✅ Do easy questions first (multiple choice, definitions)
- ✅ Show ALL work on calculations (partial credit!)
- ✅ Use provided boxes/tables for page replacement
- ✅ Answer "in one sentence" means exactly that - be concise!

### Question Strategy
1. **First pass:** All multiple choice and 1-sentence definitions (30 mins)
2. **Second pass:** Calculations and short explanations (60 mins)
3. **Third pass:** Long answer questions (75 mins)
4. **Review:** Check your work (15 mins)

## 🎯 Expected Mark Breakdown (Target: 70+/80)

Based on past papers, here's what you can realistically aim for:

| Section | Marks Available | Target | Strategy |
|---------|----------------|--------|----------|
| Multiple Choice | 5-7 | 5-7 | Should get all - they're straightforward |
| Definitions | 5-7 | 5-7 | Memorize, easy marks |
| Page Replacement | 9 | 7-9 | Practice makes perfect |
| ALU Table | 4 | 4 | Memorizable |
| Memory Allocation | 2-4 | 2-3 | Practice the pattern |
| Long Answers | 40-50 | 30-40 | Partial credit available |
| **TOTAL** | **80** | **60-75** | **Passing with distinction** |

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ **Not showing work** on calculations → No partial credit
2. ❌ **Forgetting initial page faults** in page replacement (all frames start empty!)
3. ❌ **Writing paragraphs** for "one sentence" questions → Lose time, might lose marks
4. ❌ **Mixing up RAW/WAR/WAW** → Know that RAW = "true dependency"
5. ❌ **Not using the boxes provided** for page replacement work
6. ❌ **Spending too long** on 1-mark questions
7. ❌ **Forgetting to answer all parts** of multi-part questions
8. ❌ **Leaving questions blank** → Always write something, partial credit exists!

## 🎊 Final Encouragement

You have excellent preparation materials based on 12 years of past papers! The topics are consistent, especially in Willem's papers (2012-2022). The patterns are clear:

- **Memory management dominates** (paging, replacement, fragmentation)
- **Mic-1 architecture is important** (registers, ALU, microcode)
- **Pipeline concepts appear regularly** (dependencies, branch prediction)
- **Definitions are free marks** if you memorize them

**Key insight:** Willem likes to ask the SAME questions year after year with minor variations. Master the patterns in PRACTICE_PROBLEMS.md and you'll be well-prepared!
