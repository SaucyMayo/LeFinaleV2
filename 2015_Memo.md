## Question Summary & Answers

### Multiple Choice (typical)
- **Intel ISA:** Know which instructions affect ESP (call, push, pop, ret) vs don't (cmp, test, mov)
- **Mic-1 ALU:** H register constraints in arithmetic operations
- **Memory:** Proportional allocation formula, page replacement policies
- **Pipeline:** RAW/WAR/WAW dependency types
- **Paging:** Second-chance algorithm page classes

### Definitions (1 mark each)
- **Bus skew:** Signal timing variations on bus lines
- **Sign extension:** Replicate sign bit when widening signed values
- **Unified cache:** Single cache for instructions and data
- **Register renaming:** Map architectural to physical registers
- **Internal fragmentation:** Waste within allocated blocks
- **External fragmentation:** Scattered free space between blocks
- **Copy-on-write:** Share until write, then copy
- **Thrashing:** Excessive paging dominates execution

### Calculations
**Page Replacement:**
- Reference string → apply LRU and FIFO
- Count page faults for each
- Demonstrate Belady's Anomaly (FIFO paradox)

**ALU Control:**
- Configure F0, F1, ena, inva, inc for each function
- Understand two's complement for subtraction

### Long Questions
**Architecture:**
- Mic-1 data path and control store
- Pipelining strategies and hazards
- Branch prediction (static vs dynamic)

**Memory:**
- Virtual memory concepts
- Page tables and TLB
- Demand paging vs caching
- Segmentation vs paging

**File Systems:**
- Unix inodes structure
- FAT allocation
- Hard links and permissions

Total: Variable marks (calculated out of 80)
